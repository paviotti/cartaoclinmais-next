## Getting Started

This is my first project in Next.js whose objective is to create a website for a medical clinic, which contains doctors' names, addresses and their telephone numbers.

```bash
The name of the clinic is CLIN+
```

## The first part

- I post the menu and root in this first part, but it has a lot of rubbish, and experimental components that will be removed in the next commit.
- One important component in this commit is the context (MenuContext.tsx) whith allow shared variables.
